# kibana

1. Dont forget to change to solorunner, in default spec.
â‹…â‹…â‹… Complete the spec_helper.â‹…â‹…
... in .kitchen.yml :â‹…â‹…

```platforms:
  - name: ubuntu-16.04
    driver:
      box: ubuntu/xenial64
```

2. Kibana needs Java to work. We choose the 8th version as to avoid any bugs.
This is a bit of a tricky part, here is the configuration :
in default.rb
```package "openjdk-8-jdk" do
  action :install
end
# the package for java 8
```
in default test
```describe package("openjdk-8-jdk") do
  it { should be_installed }
  its('version') { should match '8u181-b13-0ubuntu0.16.04.1'  }
end
```
in default spec
```it "should install openjdk-8-jdk" do
  expect(chef_run).to install_package("openjdk-8-jdk")
end
```

3. Establish tests.

4. Do the CI pipeline :
```+ chef exec rspec spec

kibana::default
  When all attributes are default, on Ubuntu 16.04
    converges successfully
    should install transport
    should install kibana
    should install openjdk-8-jdk
    should update sources
    should enable kibana
    should run bash to wget the key for elastic stack
    should add bash https
    should create a kibana.yml in /etc/kibana/kibana.yml

5. Do the packer pipeline.
